Subjective Evaluation System for Audio in VR

This research aims at developing a subjective evaluation system for audio in VR. If the angle and orientation of the listener's head changes, the apparent position of the audio source in VR and the 3D sound in VR will not work properly. To solve this problem, we have developed the current system. In addition, we sought to simplify the tasks of the subjects and the experimenters. As a result of this project, the subjective accuracy of the experiments is expected to improve, and in addition, the experimental efficiency is improved.
